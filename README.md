## Oh, hello.

I'm Dan Laugharn, a full stack engineer at [Amherst](https://www.amherst.com) helping build new products for the consumer divison like https://bungalohomes.com, https://sell.bungalohomes.com, https://pecanre.com and more. 

In my evenings and weekends, I'm building [This](https://this.sh), a low stakes platform for a better internet.
