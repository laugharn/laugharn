## Oh, hello.

I'm Dan Laugharn, a full stack engineer at [Amherst](https://www.amherst.com) helping build new products for the consumer divison like https://bungalohomes.com, https://sell.bungalohomes.com, https://pecanre.com and more.

Instead of doing a Code Advent this year, I'm spending December building [This](https://this.sh), a low stakes platform with the goal of being an enjoyable place to go online.

Here are some of the libraries and services I've been using:

- 🏗 [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)
- 🎨 [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)
- 🗄 [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma)
- 📠 [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- 📡 [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com)
