Hi, Iâ€™m Dan. Currently I'm a senior sales engineer at [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Previously I was lead engineer at [Made In](https://madeincookware.com), and before that I was at [Amherst](https://www.amherst.com) and [Aceable](https://www.aceable.com). I lifted the structure of this handbook from Malte Ubl.

## Values, Principles, and Beliefs

- There's never been a better time to be making things than right now
- Nothing beats iteration velocity
- Assume circumstances will change
- Reduce complexity and complication as much as possible, but choose complexity over complication
- Collaboration is the best

## Engineering style

- Demo driven development
- Alphabetize (_deeply_ underrated)
- Tooling is a means and not an ends
- Repeat yourself but not too much
- Clean while you cook

## General style

- If you get me talking I won't shut up
- If I care enough to override a default configuration, I probably care a lot
- I enjoy the simple pleasure of a job well done
- I'm austere aesthetically but also to mitigate my lack of organization skills
- I'm bad at names, eye contact, and remembering to confirm I'm attending a meeting

## Personal

- He/him
- Austin, TX
- 1 kid
- One of those "wears the same thing every day" guys
- Vegetarian mostly
